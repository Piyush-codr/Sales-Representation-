# Sales-Representation-
This is a project made by using Power BI. 

Rx Sales Application:
This Rx Sales measures and monitors the performance of a UK pharmaceutical sales representative in areas
where there are dispensing doctors.
A sales representative or sales manager would use this application to see how they were performing with
respect to their peers. They may also use this application to analyse good and bad performing areas within
their application  territory and drill deeper into the data to seek out reasons why particular parts of their territory was
performing well or badly. Armed with this information they may choose to redirect their activity in a more
efficient manner
